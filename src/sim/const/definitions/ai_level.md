For the sake of convenience, we will measure the capabilities of an AI by "AI Level"
| AI Level | Max duration of task         |
|----------|------------------------------|
| 1        | 1 hour                       |
| 2        | 3 hours                      |
| 3        | 10 hours (~1 human day)      |
| 4        | 30 hours (~4 human days)     |
| 5        | 100 hours (~2 human weeks)   |
| 6        | 300 hours (~1 human months)  |
| 7        | 1000 hours (~4 human months) |
AI Level can be a real number, for example 1.5.
Please remember that AI levels are only analogies for how intelligent an AI is.
